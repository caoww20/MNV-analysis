# miRNA database
    @ Basic query: Query information based on MNVID or RSID or miRNA or region. Including MNV information, gene information, binding information, secondary structure change information
    @ Secondary structure query (for regions falling on pre-miRNA genes)
    @ miRBS query (for MNVs falling in the UTR3 region)
    @ miRBS prediction module (with 2 built-in software): miRNA sequence, target sequence
    @ Secondary structure prediction module (secondary structure)
